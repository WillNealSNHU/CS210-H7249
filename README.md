Module Eight Journal

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Creating an simple personal investing app tracking various things like monthly deposits, the initial investment, apr, and the number of years.  

What did you do particularly well?
I think my code was pretty easy to read, commented everything I did in a fun and informative way.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I should have built out more pseudocode before starting. I tend to dive right into projects like this and then get hung up on poor architecture later.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
" cout << (i + 1) << "\t\t$" << fixed << setprecision(2) << totalAmOT << "\t\t\t$" << intAmt << "\n"; "
That line right there was pretty interesting to me. The syntax of printing out and incrementing is different than other languages I know. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think knowing C++ is extremely valuable. Any OOP language that is a programming language is high value to me personally. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Maintainable by decent architecture, readable by several comments and industry standard naming conventions, and adaptable by having several specific variables. 

I enjoyed this class, I learned a lot and I appreciate your time and patience.
